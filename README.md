This repository contains the code and simulations supporting my undergraduate thesis for Princeton University, "A Continuous-Time Optimal Control Framework for Individualized Tapering in Swimming". The research applies optimal control theory to a continuous-time fitness-fatigue model to derive personalized training and tapering strategies that maximize performance at a target competition time.
Project Structure - Thesis.ipynb is the main jupyter notbook containing:
- Implementation of the continuous-time fitness-fatigue dynamics
- Solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation using finite differences
- Optimal training control simulations for varying athlete profiles
- Sensitivity analyses and FFT analysis of performance
